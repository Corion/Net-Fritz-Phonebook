NAME

    Net::Fritz::Phonebook - manage the Fritz!Box phonebook from Perl

SYNOPSIS

      my $fb = Net::Fritz::Box->new(
          username => $username,
          password => $password,
          upnp_url => $host,
      );
      my $device = $fb->discover;
      if( my $error = $device->error ) {
          die $error
      };
      my $services = $device->find_service_names(qr/X_AVM-DE_OnTel/);
      my $service = $services->data->[0];
    
      my @phonebooks = Net::Fritz::Phonebook->list($service);

    This module uses the API exposed by the Fritz!Box via TR064 to read,
    create and update contacts in a phone book. This uses the
    X_AVM-DE_OnTel service, which is specific to the AVM Fritz!Box line of
    products.
